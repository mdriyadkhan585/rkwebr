**Task:** You are tasked with creating an extraordinarily advanced Python web framework named **"rkwebr,"** designed to be **10,000+ times better** than Django and any other existing web frameworks. This framework should set a new standard in web development, offering unparalleled performance, scalability, and flexibility. The owner and creator of this framework is **"RK Riad."** The code must be meticulously designed to be error-free, with comprehensive explanations and documentation for every component.
<br>
**Important Notice:** ChatGPT 4.0 must remember everything stated in this prompt. **Do not make any mistakes, no matter how small**—any error could result in the entire program being broken or wasted. The integrity of the "rkwebr" framework is of utmost importance, and it must be flawless in its execution.

### **Framework Features:**

1. **Revolutionary Architecture:**
   - Develop a **hyper-modular** architecture that allows for complete customization of every aspect of the framework.
   - Introduce a **self-optimizing core** that automatically adapts to hardware and application needs, optimizing memory usage, processing power, and I/O operations in real-time.
   - Include a **micro-kernel** design that separates core functionalities from optional components, ensuring the framework is lightweight but can scale infinitely with plugins.

2. **Next-Gen ORM and Database Handling:**
   - Implement a **universal ORM** capable of abstracting not only SQL and NoSQL databases but also hybrid storage systems (e.g., file-based, in-memory, distributed databases).
   - Introduce **AI-driven query optimization,** where queries are automatically rewritten for optimal performance based on database statistics and usage patterns.
   - Support **automatic data sharding and replication** for massive scalability, with built-in tools to manage distributed databases across multiple data centers.

3. **Ultra-Responsive Asynchronous System:**
   - Design the framework to be **entirely event-driven** and fully asynchronous, capable of handling millions of concurrent connections with minimal overhead.
   - Include **native support for distributed computing,** allowing the framework to operate seamlessly across clusters of servers.
   - Provide out-of-the-box **integration with real-time processing systems** like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and custom event-driven architectures.

4. **Quantum-Grade Security:**
   - Develop **quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms** to future-proof the framework against emerging threats.
   - Implement **adaptive security layers** that automatically adjust protection mechanisms based on threat detection, user behavior, and system load.
   - Include a **zero-trust security model** with built-in support for hardware security modules (HSMs), end-to-end encryption, and decentralized authentication systems.

5. **Infinite Scalability and Performance:**
   - Create a **self-scaling infrastructure** that dynamically allocates resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) based on real-time load analysis.
   - Integrate **machine learning algorithms** to predict traffic patterns and pre-scale infrastructure accordingly, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.
   - Ensure the framework can handle **trillions of requests per second** by utilizing advanced networking techniques like HTTP/3, QUIC, and edge computing.

6. **AI-Augmented Developer Experience:**
   - Introduce an **AI-powered code generator** that can automatically write, refactor, and optimize code based on high-level descriptions from developers.
   - Provide a **context-aware IDE plugin** that offers intelligent code suggestions, real-time error detection, and automated documentation generation.
   - Include a **natural language interface** that allows developers to configure the framework, write routes, and manage databases using plain English commands.

7. **Unmatched Templating and Frontend Integration:**
   - Develop a **universal templating engine** that supports multiple templating languages (e.g., Jinja2, Mustache, EJS) and can seamlessly integrate with any frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular).
   - Implement **real-time template rendering** with hot-reloading, ensuring developers see changes instantly without refreshing the browser.
   - Introduce a **dynamic component system** that allows for the creation of reusable frontend components with built-in state management and event handling.

8. **Ultimate Routing and Middleware System:**
   - Create a **self-learning routing system** that optimizes route matching and dispatching based on usage patterns, ensuring minimal response times.
   - Provide a **contextual middleware engine** that can dynamically adjust middleware execution based on request context (e.g., user role, API version).
   - Support **cross-protocol routing,** allowing the same application to handle HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, and GraphQL requests seamlessly.

9. **AI-Powered API and GraphQL Management:**
   - Integrate **AI-driven API management** that automatically generates, documents, and version-controls APIs based on code annotations and usage patterns.
   - Provide **intelligent GraphQL schema management,** with automatic schema generation, validation, and optimization based on data models and query analysis.
   - Include a **real-time API analytics dashboard** that offers deep insights into API performance, usage trends, and potential bottlenecks.

10. **Infinite Scalability and Auto-Healing:**
    - Design the framework to be **infinitely scalable** by automatically distributing workloads across multiple servers, data centers, or cloud regions without any developer intervention.
    - Include **auto-healing mechanisms** that detect and resolve issues (e.g., server crashes, memory leaks, deadlocks) in real-time without affecting application uptime.
    - Provide built-in support for **serverless computing,** allowing developers to deploy functions that automatically scale based on demand.

11. **Real-Time Collaboration and DevOps Integration:**
    - Enable **real-time collaboration** within the framework, where multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously with live syncing.
    - Integrate **seamlessly with DevOps pipelines** (CI/CD) with built-in support for automated testing, deployment, and rollback.
    - Include **real-time monitoring and alerting** with AI-powered anomaly detection to proactively identify and resolve performance issues.
